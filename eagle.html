                SUPERTHERM ® is a unique single component combination of high performance aliphatic urethanes, elastomeric acrylics, standard acrylics and resin additives in a water borne formula. No co-solvents are present and will dry by evaporation. Due to the unique combination of acrylics and urethanes, SUPERTHERM ® cures out completely in 14 - 21 days to an extremely tough, durable, non-yellowing, water resistant coating that also provides flexibility, water proofing and UV stability. SUPERTHERM ® has passed 2000 hours of salt spray testing which equals marine specifications and in fact has DNV certification.

          SUPERTHERM ® was built to meet the requirements of industrial uses which required a tough surface, and provide flexibility against stresses of contraction and expansion. Also, unlike all other "reflective" paints on the market which offer only a single reflective ceramic to provide heat reflection, SUPERTHERM ® is designed with four separate ceramic compounds for insulation from radiant heat, reflection, conduction and convection. SUPERTHERM ® ceramics are not the rough multifaceted type as the one found in other coatings.
